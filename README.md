# Handle json documents with python 3

### The Project
This is a project created to **handle json files in Python 3.**

This project is about create and  managing file containing json document in python.
On it I build an app witch perform a **CRUD ACTION** on a json file. 
The App use **OOP** and **Microserce Architecture** and **OOD PRINCIPLES | SOLID** and 
organized like you can see on tab **<> Code** (in the top left menu).
- The folder **JsonHandlerPackage** is a python package witch contain others packages and modules(classes, python files). 
Each module keeps some methods, where each method is responsible to execute one type of task.
The classes  has the same name with python file.
- The folder **files_json** keeps a json file created to test thet project. 
So,  That is a structure seted up to satisfy the  **Microserce Architecture** adopted .

The file **main.py** has one class ans one method, the main one, called - **main()** wich one controlls the app fully.

### Running App
To run this app you need to execute **main.py** file.
